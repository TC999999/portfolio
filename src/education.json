      "description": "During my years at Stetson, I studied physics, where I learned about proper laboratory safety skills and developed my skills at presenting my results in front of my peers. I would also help my classmates whenever they needed help with their work, and return they helped me. Furthermore, I worked as a TA for an Intro to University Physics class in my senior year where I graded students' work and set up office hours for them to come and ask for help. I also took a couple of coding classes where I learned the basics of software development.",
